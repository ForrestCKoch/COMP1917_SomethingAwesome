Main will initialize DataStruct which will provide information about:
	    - Data Size
	    - # elements in file
	    - which function to read data/fill array
	    - which compare function to use
	    .......


which module to use -----> loadModule--> Fills--> DataStruct

createJob takes:    (Should we pass this as a struct?)
	    - DataStruct
	    - Sorting Alg
	    - # threads
	    - file names?

createJob:
	FUNC1:
	    - Uses functions provided from DataStruct to generate array
	    
	FUNC2:
	    - Divides Array into # threads
	    - Sort Alg ----> each thread
	    - Merge ----> each sorted thread
	    
	FUNC3:
	    - output File from function from DataStruct?
